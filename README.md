# Analysis of Home HVAC Runtime Data and Utility Bills

This project is just some fun exploring whether recent energy retrofits have
resulted in substantially lower energy usage, and whether patterns in HVAC
runtime and humidity data show any interesting trends.

I have utility bills for a long period, but have only "saved" ecobee data a few
times. 

## Data Sources
